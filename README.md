## ðŸ’» For the Java Enthusiasts

Shrek is built with Java and follows OOP principles. Here's a peek at the chatbot entry point:

```java
public class Shrek {
    private final Storage storage;
    private final TaskList tasks;
    private final Ui ui;

    public Shrek(String filePath) {
        ui = new Ui();
        storage = new Storage(filePath);
        tasks = new TaskList(storage.load());
    }

    public String getResponse(String input) {
        // Process user input and return response
        try {
            Instruction instruction = Parser.parse(input);
            return instruction.execute(tasks, ui, storage);
        } catch (ShrekException e) {
            return ui.showError(e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
