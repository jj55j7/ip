# AI-Assisted Development

This project utilized AI tools to enhance code quality, fix issues, and improve development efficiency.

## Tools Used
- GitHub Copilot
- ChatGPT
- Deepseek


## Areas Assisted by AI

### 1. GUI Enhancement
**Tool**: Deepseek  
**Purpose**: Fixed stage closure timing issue after "bye" command  
**Changes**:
- Modified JavaFX stage close behavior
- Added proper 2-second delay before application exit
- Ensured graceful shutdown process

### 2. Documentation Improvement
**Tool**: ChatGPT
**Purpose**: Enhanced code documentation and readability
**Changes**:
- Added comprehensive Javadoc comments for all classes and methods
- Improved method headers with parameter descriptions and return values
- Standardized documentation format across the codebase

### 3. CI/CD Configuration
**Tool**: GitHub Copilot
**Purpose**: Fixed GitHub Actions workflow issues
**Changes**:
- Debugged and corrected `.yml` configuration syntax errors
- Resolved Git checkout and merge issues in CI pipeline
- Optimized Gradle build configuration for multi-platform testing

### 4. Code Refactoring
**Tool**: Deepseek
**Purpose**: Maintain OOP principles and avoid code duplication
**Changes**:
- Assisted in extracting reusable code chunks
- Suggested proper inheritance structures
- Helped identify and fix copy-paste errors
- Recommended design pattern implementations

### 5. Error Message Parsing
**Tool**: ChatGPT
**Purpose**: Improve user feedback and error handling
**Changes**:
- Enhanced exception messages for better user understanding
- Standardized error message formats
- Added context-specific error suggestions

## Benefits Gained
- **Faster Development**: Reduced time spent on boilerplate code
- **Improved Quality**: Better documentation and error handling
- **Reduced Bugs**: AI-assisted debugging and syntax checking
- **Learning Enhancement**: Exposure to best practices and patterns

## Note
All AI-generated code was reviewed, tested, and adapted to fit the project's specific requirements and coding standards.
