## üí° Tips & Tricks

- **Duplicate Prevention**: Shrek automatically prevents adding identical tasks
- **Auto-save**: Your tasks are saved automatically after every command
- **Case Insensitive**: Commands work regardless of uppercase/lowercase
- **Flexible Event Times**: You can specify event times in either order (`/from` then `/to` or `/to` then `/from`)

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How do I transfer my tasks to another computer?**
A: Copy the `data/shrek.txt` file from your current computer to the same location on the new computer.

**Q: What happens if I accidentally close the application?**
A: Your tasks are automatically saved, so you won't lose any data when you reopen the application.

**Q: Can I edit tasks directly in the data file?**
A: Yes, but be careful! The file format is specific. Make a backup first if you need to edit it manually.

**Q: Why can't I add the same task twice?**
A: Shrek prevents duplicate tasks to keep your list clean and organized.

## üêõ Known Issues

- Sorting by date puts todos at the end since they don't have dates
- `sort` does not overwrite the ordering of tasks (it is simply for display)
